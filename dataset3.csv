Revenue and growth were outcome of that mindset, not the only objective. Thank you all for your help in this experience – for the countless friends that I acquired over the years.

As we walked, many women stopped us to talk about what RBG meant to them, and it meant a lot to us to have that connection with strangers in a time of such sadness in the country.I’m angry that we have all been denied the opportunity to celebrate this extraordinary woman because the sadness we feel about her death is mixed immediately with fear and anxiety about what may lie ahead. It’s important to take a moment to remember that Ruth Bader Ginsburg changed the world for women. Long before she was Justice Ginsburg she fought for women’s equality in every realm--in the economy, in politics, and at home. She reminded us that there’s nothing absurd about dreaming of a future where nine women sit on the Supreme Court. It’s impossible to overstate what she did for us. Despite her small stature, she leaves enormous shoes to fill.The days since her passing have felt especially hard. I don’t know what the future will bring, but I hope we can all find strength for the challenges ahead in Justice Ginsburg’s fighting spirit.",5,92,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,tendencias,0.45,1292

The online learning platform roughly doubled overnight when schools shut down during COVID The company’s stock is up almost 80 percent this year. I’m excited as it is not only professionally exhilarating to join Marc Boxser and the rest of the world-class team at Chegg, but a personal passion. As a mom of two school-age boys with individualized needs, I see their daily struggles to learn and grow. I believe every student worldwide deserves the chance to reach their full potential. They should not be inhibited by access, or affordability. Chegg started out as an education technology company focused on affordability and accessibility, but now the company helps students every step of their journey from learning to earning.

This means our policies have a direct impact on communities around the world, and it makes caring for those communities a clear business imperative.

Alan Murray,64379,"“When I think of law firms, I think of them as super-spreaders - but in a good way! They have such a broad reach.” This statement couldn’t be more true, as stated by Margery Kraus, Founder and Executive Chairman of APCO Worldwide,  and the moderator of a panel discussion “Leading with Courage: A Statement from Business Leaders for Renewed Global Cooperation” during one of the United Nations opening plenary sessions this morning.“It is around value and purpose – not just what the law says. What can we as a law firm do to understand the issues and ultimately give better advice to clients?” Kevin Coon of global law firm Baker McKenzie.“The Big4 accounting firms have done some good work – but more needs to be done around measurement and accountability – to help ensure the #sdgs are achieved” added Alan Murray, CEO of Fortune Media.And finally, Dov Seidman, Founder and Chairman of LRN and The HOW Institute for Society, added “The business of business is no longer just business. The business of business now must be society!”Wise words, indeed.Many great sessions remain during this week’s General Assembly of the United Nations in this, the 75th year since its inception. #lawfirms #accountancy #esg #buildbackbetter #UnitingBusiness",5,58,0,0,0,0,1,6,5,5,negocios,0.63,1243

Alan Murray,64379,"Back in 2014, Marzieh Ebrahimi had an appointment with a dentist and was stuck in traffic in the central Iranian province of Isfahan. She rolled down her car’s window only to see a huge volume of pure acid splashed on her face.  Unfortunately, she lost part of her face and the cornea of an eye in the acid attack.Police never caught the perpetrators, as it is usually the case despite the fact that the street was surveyed by video cameras. All these horrible acts were directed towards women who were not wearing conservative outfits. Many Iranians believe that these attacks were made in complicity with different authorities to discourage women from adopting a more liberal way of dressing. But both national and local authorities denied any involvement.    Today Marzieh raises awareness about these terrible attacks and advocates for the ban of acid sales.Despite this tragedy, the news of her marriage 3 years later made headlines in media and social media. #strength #courage #resilience #advocacy #hope #progressThank you to the Atlas of Beauty and the many other media articles for bringing this story to light.",8,64,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0,tendencias,0.55,1121

In a closing submission to the quarantine inquiry, she warned the board to treat Mr Andrews’ claims with “caution”. “The fact that no such Cabinet, or Cabinet Committee process, was engaged for the setting up of the hotel quarantine program is the root cause of some of the issues which have been ventilated before the board in the course of this inquiry,” the submission said. Ms Mikakos said had the hotel quarantine program been the “product” of a Cabinet or Cabinet Committee decision the issues would not have arisen.“More importantly, such a process would have enabled differing views and potential risks and weaknesses with the program to be identified and addressed prior to its establishment,” she said.The rule of law in Victoria and our democracy and politics is broken. #COVID #victorialockdown #quarantine #democracy #mentalhealth #leadership #victoriangovernment",15,33,0,0,1,0,1,7,0,0,responsabilidad social,0.58,1069

Uniquely, the Val Morgan Group offered an integrated campaign solution spanning Val Morgan’s Digital and Outdoor networks.  The editorially-led campaign strategy saw five bespoke articles created by TheLatch—‘s in-house editorial team, outlining but a few of RedBalloon experiences. Content aligned with current events, including ‘post-iso’ local travel ideas and Father’s Day gifts to support local communities.  The material was then amplified across the VMO network. Utilising VMO Shop screens, RedBallon were able to access extensive reach and connect with shoppers who were in the mindset to make purchasing decisions. The VMO Active network also played a pivotal role, amplifying the content to a unique, active audience – who are proven to possess a positive and receptive mindset – and within an environment that is contextually relevant to the experience-hungry demographic.

Read The Conversation article & please share.Governments need to have a willingness to engage a broad range of expertise.A sole focus on predicting and controlling COVID case numbers fails to take into account the other compelling consequences of our public policy. We need to draw on the predictive powers of psychologists & psychiatrists, sociologists & anthropologists, economists & educators + the epidemiologists.These 3 principles — an international perspective, a breadth of expertise and an ability to look to the long-term as well as the short — show us precisely where Australia, and especially Victoria, has gone wrong. When Premier Andrews announced his roadmap out of lockdown, none of these conditions were met.The Andrews administration have not learned from global best practice & show no interest in doing so. In fact, the only references to other countries made by government officials have been derogatory & dismissive.Most worryingly of all, the Andrews roadmap says nothing about the long-term consequences of lockdown, incl. a future where there is no workable vaccine & societies around the world must learn to live with the virus.#COVID #Victoria #Australia #leadership #publicpolicy #victorialockdown #liberty #policestate",18,61,0,0,0,0,1,8,0,0,responsabilidad social,0.47,1289

James Caan CBE,3259611,"The government’s latest economic intervention is a complete knee jerk reaction. The decision to offer £1,000 to any company that brings any worker back from furlough is generous at best, wasteful at worst.Many companies that were going to bring back workers anyway are set to receive a free windfall. I commend Primark’s decision to refuse this payment, but not everyone is going to follow in their footsteps.It seems as if ministers are simply throwing money at the situation and hoping for the best.In my view, a better way of doing things would have been to activate this payment after you have brought at least 50% of your workforce back.If you bring back up to 75% you should receive the payment, and there is a business argument to increase the payment for companies that bring back 75-100% of their workforce.This could have saved millions.That money could have been poured into training those left unemployed for the new world we are living in.The genie is out of the bottle, and we are not putting it back.

They are focused on the past. Of course they form a foundation, but to make a decision I need tangible evidence of the present. It’s a face-to-face discussion over a video call that really opens my eyes to the complete picture of the candidate.

James Caan CBE,3259611,"A friend of mine who was starting his own business recently told me that he was spending too much time on his IT, tweaking his website, looking after his office in lockdown and various other administrative issues. He was used to coming into the office and having everything ready for him when he worked as an employee. As an entrepreneur, I understand the stress of having a company’s success rest on your shoulders. The stress is especially pronounced for anyone who has spent a long time work for huge, established companies: they are used to being a cog in a machine, taking the power of the brand for granted and having clients flock to them with minimal effort. Try to undertake these administrative tasks outside of key business hours. An hour of negativity can easily translate into a bad day, which if not rectified turns into a bad week, which can easily turn into a bad month. Starting a business is always going to be difficult, especially in today’s climate. Many successful businesses were started in adverse conditions so don’t be put off. But the more work you put in, the more you will get out of it.  You just have to believe in yourself and be prepared to give it 100% and roll your sleeves up, get stuck in and enjoy the ride. #Entrepreneurship #Founder #Business",29,472,0,0,1,0,1,3,0,0,negocios,0.78,1282
James Caan CBE,3259611,"In an interview, whether it is in person or over video, I like to see examples of a person’s work.

I was trying to evaluate the usual questions: is he right, is he wrong, can he do the job, can’t he do the job? There were a hundred things going on in my mind, but that one document answered all of my questions.   It demonstrated, in one hit, his style, ability and skill set.   I didn’t have to read it all.  Just scanning through it told me that he was the right person for the job. Ultimately, it’s all about the impression you leave. So give the interviewer tangible evidence of your credentials. It could be a report, your position on a league table, a testimonial, a reference or even an example of your work.

Relationships are built on this, but maintaining them is what really allows your venture to thrive. As you build your network of clients, your list of potential referees grows too.  In the recruitment business, I have always found referrals from existing clients an extremely powerful tool. This also applies to candidates. If you have performed well and you call the client back with another top candidate, they are going to be interested. You live or die by your reputation, and a positive reputation builds momentum. That is why at Alexander Mann, I worked so hard to make sure the candidate met the client’s needs. We are naturally inclined to stick with who we know. Using your hard-won network to reach out to others is an incredibly powerful tool. It’s simpler, faster and more enjoyable.  So really, it all comes down to the business to deliver a high-quality service and keep the relationship going.

Please listen before you vote and share. “I spend time briefing the Vice President [Joe Biden] on a regular basis on COVID. We talk about the plans that he wants to develop. And what has struck me about him is that he is very, he’s really focused on the practical and the personal, I would say those are two sort of themes that guide him.And when I say the personal, what I mean is he grasps numbers with great dexterity. He understands key concepts. He knows what the big drivers are of spread, et cetera. He knows a lot of that stuff, but he’s anchored in the personal, his sense that he always wants to know, how is this affecting an everyday mom or dad, how is this affecting small businesses on the street?” #biden2020 #bidenharris2020 #bidenharris #COVID #DrVivekMurthy #RemarkablePeople #smallbusiness #smallbusinessrecovery",51,102,0,0,0,1,1,8,0,0,responsabilidad social,0.56,886

They have been carrying the rest of your Black talent in their hearts and in their arms for years, intervening when people want to leave, negotiating opportunities for them, navigating misunderstandings with executive peers on their behalf, listening to them vent about the structural racism in your company and offering support, even while they themselves suffer from it. They have, in some cases, single-handedly prevented multiple “mass exodus” moments triggered by some insensitive thing you did or said. Your Black execs have been toiling. For years. YEARS. A whole extra job, out of love and a sense of purpose. Without acknowledgment or appreciation or hazard pay.It’s your turn. You have the hard conversations. You listen. You show empathy.

David Edelman,1137133,"This Friday I was unexpectedly admitted to the hospital for critically low sodium and chloride levels which I have been managing for a while now, but lately my levels have dropped to a point that they thought it was prudent to have me monitored as they brought it back up to a safe level. After being admitted, a team of specialist including my Endocrinologist, coordinated a plan to safely bring my sodium up. They adjusted my medication and monitored my vitals as they slowly were able to correct it. But while I was going through this weekend, I began to re-appreciate why I got into the healthcare practice and field in the first place. As I walked around and talked to other patients, I learned about their personal situations and how, in their minds, they could have been a little more proactive in managing their conditions and avoided what is now more of an acute care situation.  As I heard these patients describe their “why”, the rationale ranged from the cost of healthcare, difficultly navigating the system, and ease of access. It made me re-appreciate how proud I am to spend my career trying to help people on their path to better health, and ultimately what it means to be well-being ready and proactively manage your well-being journey.

This woman is extremely accomplished in her field, is well respected in her industry and teaches at a renowned university. She recently became unemployed and shared her thoughts and lessons about what she could have done differently in her last role.She said, “I advocated for everyone but myself. I didn’t ask for help because I didn’t want anyone to think I wasn’t capable. I didn’t track my own successes because I didn’t want to occur boastful. I felt like I was always trying to prove myself so they would see my worth.”She gave almost a decade of employment to her former organization. No outplacement. No career coaching. Just good bye. This happens daily in current economic situations. The lesson is - Ladies, no one is coming.

I am not one who believes the world is run by secret societies or “the commission” (nod to Umbrella ☂ Academy), & enjoy Myth Busters & Snopes.Today, I’m going to “fact check” the urban legend that Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are black holes:- Myth #1: The ATS uses artificial intelligence that reject you when you apply for a job.Truth: Often when you get an auto reject right after applying for a job, it’s because you answered “no” to a question that you should have answered “yes” to. An example of a screen out question is “Do you have a BSN nursing degree?” If you answered “no” and having a BSN is a job requirement, the screen out question would rule you out. - Myth #2: An ATS can’t read shading & text bolding Truth: Modern resumes include design elements like shading and light pops of color. The average recruiter only spends 6-8 seconds scanning the resume to decide if they want to continue reading it. You have to draw the readers eyes to the text you want them to see What are other #myths?",52,146,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,tendencias,0.53,1283

Ilya Pozin,856407,"While cleaning out the garage today I found this business plan for my first startup, Cductive, which was one of the first digital music retailers. My cofounders, John Rigos and Alan Manuel, and I bootstrapped the company and raised a bit of angel funding, running the business super lean in frothy times. Our vision for the digital distribution of music was ultimately correct but we were way too early and we were fortunate to be acquired a few years before the first iPod was released (which I also found in the garage today...keeper!). There were many early learnings: the power of building a mission-driven organization; the importance of market timing; it's hard to compete with free (e.g. Napster); paradox of choice; access to capital is half the battle; 10x team members are invaluable and can help you outmaneuver much bigger rivals; and, importantly, that startups are hard as hell but far more rewarding and fun. All of these lessons served me extremely well at Pluto TV and I'll be forever grateful for the magical experience and amazing people I worked with at Cductive back in the day.

Ilya Pozin,856407,"Thank you, Andrew Paul of Slate Magazine, for writing one of the most insightful pieces ever published about our business opportunity and why ""the future of digital streaming is Pluto TV."" Andrew has many choice quotes, but my favorite is this:""Pluto TV also takes away the anxiety of choice plaguing most of its competitors. Too often have I succumbed to the Death Scroll, that interminable amount of time spent deciding what, exactly, to watch—a process made exponentially more stressful by the number of people seated around the screen. On the one hand, the appeal of a decisionless downtime might sound unnerving, lazy, or even slightly soul-crushing (that’s probably because it, in actuality, is all the above). But that doesn’t change the simple fact that, at any given time, I can turn on Pluto TV to a random channel and be, at the very least, mildly entertained for an indefinite period of time.

What can other students be doing in learning stations while you work directly with students more in need?  3) Consider additional school resources. Is there school-based tutoring/remediation support outside of the classroom to compliment what is happening in the classroom?  It's not either/or but both. Is there an enrichment/GT program?

JT O'Donnell,2670742,"I'm going to share with you a simple framework to help you determine if it's time to make a change in your career.I'm going to break this down into 3 easy steps: Step 1: Understanding ""Experience + Learn = Grow""The reality today is that if you aren't constantly growing in your job, you're dying. What I mean by this is that the experiences you have should build up your skill sets, and it's really important that every few months you take a step back and assess if this is actually happening.Step 2: Analyze Your Experiences & SkillsThe skills themselves you develop along the way matter, because the reality today is that you have to continuously stay relevant to your work (as shown in the example above). As you're building up your skill sets, you are becoming more and more valuable to an employer.Step 3: Make The Decision (And Stick With It!)The last step in the process is to make the decision of whether or not to leave, and then stick with it.Once you've done the first two steps, you'll know whether or not you've hit a roadblock. If you have, you really only have two options here:A) Sit down with your boss and have an honest conversation to see what you can do to get back on track.B) Make the decision to leave.#JTTalkJobs #Careers #LinkedIn #Jobs",6,40,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,responsabilidad social,0.55,1262

JT O'Donnell,2670742,"I find people hate network as much as public speaking. I think it's because many think they are being insincere for having an agenda. But what it this real purpose of network? If you reframe how you look at it, you will find it can be a positive and rewarding experience. Here are my 3 tips to help you approach network.1. Expect nothing. Just focus on getting to know them better. Your only goal is to explore where you are similar so that you can find: - a common value- belief- past experience To create a connection.2. Do your homework. Research people in your industry. Look for the things you have in common. Have a meaningful conversation that makes you both feel energized and productive.3. Use the I.E.O. method for developing the relationship. Your initial conversations are meant to IDENTIFY where you see eye-to-eye. This will move your discussions into opportunities to EXPLORE how your skills, knowledge and experience compliment one another. Ultimately, helping you both naturally start to talk about potential OPPORTUNITIES to collaborate together. You may chat 3X and get through this process, or it might take 12X. The key is to make sure you don't rush the process. #JTTalksJobs #Network #Careers #MarketingStrategy",10,64,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,responsabilidad social,0.53,1234

JT O'Donnell,2670742,"Tips To Prepare For Job Interviews Right Now...1)  Interview prep starts BEFORE you apply. The moment you start applying, you should be ready for the unexpected call from a recruiter saying, “can we talk right now?” Saying no will cost you the interview because they have 100 more applicants.2) Each type of interview is different.  It’s important to know your audience! Recruiters screen you for basic fit. Hiring managers screen you to see if you’ll make their life easier or harder. HR wants to make sure you are a cultural fit. CEOs want to make sure you are worth the money. Knowing how to address each person in the interview process you meet with is part of making sure you get chosen as the right person.3) Thank you doesn’t mean “sell yourself.”Sending a thank-you note after every interview is a must-do.You should also try to send one to each person in the hiring process. This is NOT the time to try to sell them or recap your strengths. 4) Behavioral questions are meant to get inside your head. Employers use behavioral questions to assess your personality and depth of knowledge. I recommend that you use the Experience + Learn = Grow model when crafting your responses. #JTTalksJobs #Jobsearch #Jobseekers #JobInterviews",14,119,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,negocios,0.53,1236

Educate them calmly and positively about it's impact on your lives. i.e. your work pays bills that let them have food, shelter, water, internet, car, etc.2. Create a designated area that lets them know when you are there, you are work.3. If they are old enough, set some ground rules in terms of what is considered ""urgent"" for them to interrupt you.4. Give them an incentive to help you get through your workday at home. i.e. points for not interrupting you and keeping quiet around your desk.5. Do something special with them after work to signify your appreciation for their assistance.6. Understand that all days won't go smoothly and remember this will eventually pass.7.

JT O'Donnell,2670742,"4 Reasons You Didn't Move Forward In The Interview ProcessI work with lots of recruiters.While I can't speak for them all; I can for many. Here are 4 common reasons why you didn't move forward in the interview:1) You were a fit, but so were 5 other people. After talking to you, the recruiter had more phone screens.1 or more applicants were an even better fit than you. Since the recruiter's only supposed to submit the top 3 candidates for consideration, you didn't make the cut.2) The hiring manager said ""no"", and the recruiter can't explain why.

JT O'Donnell,2670742,"Does Your Resume Pass the ""Skim Test""?Resumes are a necessary evil. It's the career document we love to hate. Nobody feels comfortable writing about themselves.It's tempting to hire a resume writer.But doing so can kill your chances of landing the job.Instead, you should take the time to write it yourself.Here is one of my top tips to see if your resume is interview ready.Your resume must past the 'Skin Test'.Grab a friend who doesn't know what you do for work, and a stopwatch. Give the person a copy of your resume.Then, give them only 6 seconds to look at it, take it away.Why 6 seconds? That's how long recruiters spend on your resume initially.They skim it for key information. If they like what they see, the go back and read it a bit more carefully. If not? You get tossed.Does your friend get a good sense of what your key skills are?If not, you know your resume needs work.The key to a more readable resume is to have more whitespace.Don't cram everything in and use tiny fonts & small margins. Create whitespace around simplified, keyword-specific text. A 2-page resume w/ whitespace  is better than a 1-page one that's impossible-to-read #JtTalksJobs #Resume #Jobsearch #HiringAndPromotion",20,93,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,responsabilidad social,0.51,1204

But, that's not true.They're failing to use the right combination of tools and techniques.The right combination is what drives their transformation.Career transformation doesn't happen accidentally.To break it down more succinctly, if you want your career to improve, you need to:A) Close your gap in knowledge. Learn things that help you view your situation differently and enable you to identify your goal and build a clear gameplan to reach it.B) Get help through the roadblocks. Work with an expert who can help you navigate past challenges and reinforce good behaviors.C) Stay motivated and inspired to work at it daily.

This term is commonly used in the staffing industry.It refers to people with a rare combination of skill sets.So rare, it takes a ridiculous amount of effort to identify and hire them. How To Become A Purple Squirrel: Step 1: Collect attractive job postings.Find 5 - 10 job opportunities you're interested in. You should be 70% + match.They should be in the same industry or skill set.Step 2: Create a word cloud.Copy and paste the text of all the job postings in an online word cloud creator.Look for which hard and soft skill sets are most common across them.This will help you to realize which key terms are the most popular & important. Step 3: Add relevant keywords in strategic places.Take the top 10 - 12 skill sets.Add them to your LinkedIn profile and résumé​ in strategic places.The terms you put in your LinkedIn headline matter greatly. When a recruiter uses a key skillset in their search parameters & you have it in your headline, the chances you'll show up in their search results increases.The more keywords you have in the headline that match their search, the higher in the results you'll appear.#JtTalksJobs #Jobseeker #LinkedIn #Careers",8,83,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,responsabilidad social,0.54,1218

JT O'Donnell,2670742,"I find people hate network as much as public speaking. I think it's because many think they are being insincere for having an agenda. But what it this real purpose of network? If you reframe how you look at it, you will find it can be a positive and rewarding experience. Here are my 3 tips to help you approach network.1. Expect nothing. Just focus on getting to know them better. Your only goal is to explore where you are similar so that you can find: - a common value- belief- past experience To create a connection.2. Do your homework. Research people in your industry. Look for the things you have in common. Have a meaningful conversation that makes you both feel energized and productive.3. Use the I.E.O. method for developing the relationship. Your initial conversations are meant to IDENTIFY where you see eye-to-eye. This will move your discussions into opportunities to EXPLORE how your skills, knowledge and experience compliment one another. Ultimately, helping you both naturally start to talk about potential OPPORTUNITIES to collaborate together. You may chat 3X and get through this process, or it might take 12X. The key is to make sure you don't rush the process. #JTTalksJobs #Network #Careers #MarketingStrategy",5,75,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,responsabilidad social,0.53,1234

JT O'Donnell,2670742,"I'm going to share with you a simple framework to help you determine if it's time to make a change in your career.I'm going to break this down into 3 easy steps: Step 1: Understanding ""Experience + Learn = Grow""The reality today is that if you aren't constantly growing in your job, you're dying. What I mean by this is that the experiences you have should build up your skill sets, and it's really important that every few months you take a step back and assess if this is actually happening.Step 2: Analyze Your Experiences & SkillsThe skills themselves you develop along the way matter, because the reality today is that you have to continuously stay relevant to your work (as shown in the example above). As you're building up your skill sets, you are becoming more and more valuable to an employer.Step 3: Make The Decision (And Stick With It!)The last step in the process is to make the decision of whether or not to leave, and then stick with it.Once you've done the first two steps, you'll know whether or not you've hit a roadblock. If you have, you really only have two options here:A) Sit down with your boss and have an honest conversation to see what you can do to get back on track.B) Make the decision to leave.#JTTalkJobs #Careers #LinkedIn #Jobs",8,68,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,responsabilidad social,0.55,1262

JT O'Donnell,2670742,"3 Things You Can RIGHT NOW To Make Your LinkedIn Resume Stronger:1. Use key skill sets in the headline.Get rid of the long, run-on sentences in your headline. Even if they are the most creative & witty thing, they could hurt your chances of getting a job.Instead; keyword optimized the headline with the 5-6 most popular skill sets used in your profession.2. Keep the summary short.Summary, by definition, means short. Think white space and keyword optimization when crafting a short, impactful summary.(PS - NEVER write in 3rd person, you'll seem narcissistic & desperate)3. Quantify accomplishments in work history.Again, avoid long, detailed sentences. This will cause the hiring manager or recruiter to lose interest immediately.What should you do instead?Create  3-5 single-line bullet points with spacing between each one that quantifies your results. How many people did you manage? How many clients did you serve? What % of revenue growth did you deliver? How big was your budget or territory?

A decade old company with the spirit and energy of a startup, had so much to offer.

Michael Dell,1788147,"One year ago, when we signed the Business Roundtable’s new purpose statement, we had no idea just how much the economy was about to be tested by a global pandemic. As the fault lines of our society have been laid bare, it has become even more clear now that we all rely on multiple stakeholders for collective progress. At Dell Technologies, we are committed to drive change for all of our stakeholders to transform lives, cultivate inclusion and advance sustainability. A multistakeholder approach is not just what is right, it’s what we need to come out of crisis better, stronger and fairer by creating an economy that works for everyone.",26,1485,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,negocios,0.71,641

The night before the start date is all about dreaming and wondering.First week was exhausting. Lot of onboard information to absorb and new processes to follow, etc but most important, meet the Team and start interacting with them.Thankfully I had the best onboarding buddy possible, who made all these things a breeze along with the warmest welcome ever, still today can't be thankful enough to Claire Regan for all this not to mention how joyful and rewarding has been work with her and the rest of the Team. It was my new family, I was over the moon!Today a year later and still through this pandemic, I'm still over the moon, work on a very exciting product, fully remote, enjoying every single day and singing in the shower along with the birds every morning. And my Dell family has been expanding steadily and keeps going!So here, to all of you that have made of this my dreamed job and a happy life: THANK YOU.- Special thanks to Steven Roy for all you do to make this possible day after day, you are something else.#iwork4dell",2,197,1,0,0,0,1,2,0,2,negocios,0.62,1281

It is also moderated by levels of anxiety felt by employees which is likely to be high at this time. However, the silver lining is that individualistic brainstorming can lead to better creative output now3/Collaboration is being challenged.

While many organizations have attempted to solve the problem of irrational investment decision-making, they have relied on traditional, but limited solutions such as providing consumers with more information and education. Educating investors by increasing their financial literacy has not proven to be an effective method for changing behavior.Instead, by identifying the predictable irrationalities of consumer behaviour, financial institutions can set themselves up to facilitate consumer outcomes and be adaptive and successful despite the changing landscape.

If there's clear banning criteria (""hate"" likely too mushy & has no legal standing) AND clear path to redemption, plus some sort of follower portability, a version of 230 should apply.Notes:- there should be some exemption for ad insertions- emphasis should be on creating tools for users to control their own feeds, like a graphic equalizer that chooses what frequencies to over/under-emphasize- this is high-level & directional, meant as a starting pointMy #podcast exploring this solution in-depth. https://lnkd.in/gN-mQfx",0,7,1,0,0,1,0,3,0,2,responsabilidad social,0.61,1236

Steve Faktor,768367,"From Carl Sagan, 1995:I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time - when theUnited States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance.#future #predictions",26,226,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,negocios,0.58,1082

Apple and Google app stores offer those, making it hard for government to dictate what's fair without setting prices and policies for private businesses. Also not desirable.Since writing ""Why Monopoly is the Future & We Love It"" (https://lnkd.in/g_xE6dh), the natural next step is figuring out if/when/how monopolies, duopolies & oligopolies should be regulated. It's down to 3 main considerations:1) market dominance2) structural vs situational anti-competitiveness3) Short vs Long-term consumer benefitWith app stores, market dominance is clear but the other two are more murky. It's why regulators should lean towards having enough situational violations to warrant structural regulations.More on this topic soon (via newsletter at https://lnkd.in/gEpxvJP)",1,17,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,negocios,0.62,924

There are ways to set up these programs so they are exclusive brand differentiators and loyalty-builders. Real loyalty, not points program trickery.

I particularly call upon first time voters to vote in record numbers.The last five years have shown that with the blessings and participation of 130 crore Indians, what was earlier deemed impossible has now become possible. 2019 polls are about a spirit of confidence and positivity with which India is fulfilling the aspirations of its people.Guided by ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’, NDA seeks your blessings again. We spent the last five years fulfilling basic necessities that were left unfulfilled for 70 long years. Now, time has come to build on that and create a strong, prosperous & secure India. #PhirEkBaarModiSarkar",3,99725,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,negocios,0.93,818

Simon Sinek,3514710,"Monday is not my favorite day of the week.  Yesterday's Infinite Game class with Stephen Shedletzky broke that rule.Having already read the book and participated in Book Club with Simon Sinek, I wasn’t expecting a “lightbulb moment”. My expectations were exceeded! Credit goes to my partners Dave LoSavio and Christophe Burckbuchler.  Multiple discoveries were made as we unpacked the five Infinite Game principles:1.    Just Cause2.    Trusting Teams3.    Worthy Rivals4.    Existential Flexibility5.    Courage to LeadAt the outset, we saw how our just causes revolved around what it means to be part of “team human” -- our connections with others, share our knowledge to advance the knowledge of humanity, and work together to realize our potential and build a better future. (There were connections to my Why, although time didn’t allow me to ponder this).Another one of my “aha moments” was identifying a worthy rival.   Worthy rivals are the people that make you feel uncomfortable when you hear how well they handle situations in which you struggle. This is an extension of the idea that personal growth requires you to get comfortable with the idea of being uncomfortable.See Simon Sinek Inc. at https://lnkd.in/gAxww3r for details. #SimonSinek #Inspiration #Learning",30,323,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,6,responsabilidad social,0.52,1275

Simon Sinek,3514710,"Are you honest? Have you ever told a lie? You see the problem. We all think we are honest, yet we have all done things that are dishonest. We can rationalize our actions, “it’s just a little white lie,” or “yeah, but it didn’t matter.” Dr. Lenny Wong has spent years studying “ethical fading,” when organizations and individuals make unethical decisions believing they haven’t done anything wrong. What’s astounding is how pervasive it is.In this week’s episode of A Bit of Optimism, we talked about what ethical fading is and what we can do about it.

Simon Sinek,3514710,"Zoom Fatigue is real! Why is it that Zoom can zap my energy in an hour?  Well, the clock said it was just an hour, but it felt like FOREVER. Yet, there are those rare Zoom calls in which the time flies, and I leave the call full of purpose. What makes those calls so uplifting? What creates the feeling of engagement and connection?Like many, I was thrust into a “Zoom world” with little training. (I just learned there is a setting so you automatically mute when you login).   As a job seeker, I need to be able to make real connections on Zoom.   That is a tall order when it involves meeting for the first time.When I saw that Simon Sinek and his team at  Simon Sinek Inc. were offering a new class on “Build Relationships From Behind A Screen”, I jumped at the chance to learn more.  The 90 minute class with Kristen Hadeed was amazing.Not to be a spoiler, but in the first break out groups, we were instructed to do everything but listen attentively (which was hard as I was curious).  The last break-out group we used Kristin’s LISTEN technique, and it was magical.  I found myself having fun with my group members. I wanted the class to last longer!I highly recommend this class.

Simon Sinek,3514710,"We all want to belong to a cohesive team where we are accepted and understood.  We all want to feel a part of something larger than ourselves.  Why is this so elusive? What sets these teams apart?   This week, I participated in the Building Trust Teams class led by Rich Diviney and Stephen Shedletzky (aka Shed).  I gained a new appreciation for how critical trust is for teams to be able to pull together in times of stress. Without trust, teams can break apart into “every man for himself” when presented with a threat. One of the most interesting concepts was “dynamic leadership”.  In a Trusting Team, the team member best suited can seamlessly take the lead in a crises. Without this deep knowledge of each other, valuable time can be lost in debating how to approach an issue. So, how do teams get to the point where they truly understand the strengths and weaknesses of each team member?  How do you foster these relationship?  Rich Diviney gives a compelling framework for selecting team members.

Simon Sinek,3514710,"I  am excited for this Friday's Book Club with Simon. The Infinite Games is a great read for our new world as it speaks to what it takes for teams to flourish in times of change and uncertainty.I loved last week's Book Club!  Simon and Rich Diviney had a lively discussion on what it takes to build high performance teams.  Rich is a retired Navy SEAL commander who led teams who had to pull together in crisis situations.Rich provided some real gems. ""Skills direct behavior for a known situation"", and ""When you get into a unknown or uncertain situation, skills don't apply, as we lean on our attributes."" The discussion painted the picture of a high performance team made up of individual's who have skills and attributes that complement one another.  Simon connected Rich's trusting team to the Infinite Game.  Finite players try to practice for potential situations so that all the thinking has been been done.  Infinite players rely on their attributes in times of uncertainty.  Those attributes include empathy, humility, adaptability, and patience. I am eager to hear Simon's view on ethical fading and worthy rivals.  Book Club will be live at 1 pm ET this Friday on LinkedIn, Youtube and Facebook.

In this week's edition of the Digital Economy Weekly, I expand on this idea and predict how things might go through the 2020's, what struggles we (hypothetically) will face, and what a promising outcome will look like when this decade comes to a close. All of this with the hope that these crises we face will lead to a new social contract to meet the needs of the digital age, and a more robust, equitable, and compassionate order of human affairs.I also highlight some important news in the digital economy and at the Blockchain Research Institute, where we are busy gearing up for Global Blockchain Week's Blockchain Revolution Global virtual conference.

Don Tapscott,777808,"I was pleased to write for CoinDesk's ongoing #internet2030 series, where I outlined my vision for a new social contract - one that will meet the pressing needs of an increasingly digital world. In a front-page piece for Coindesk today, I detailed my thoughts on what this new social contract might look like, including new models of work and education, new models of identity, a new commitment to justice and citizen engagement, and a commitment to sustainability.

It isn’t, take a hands off approach telling employees to sink or swim. Fear based response from the team leader is quite opposite to empowerment.

It is the latest lesson that our system of government rests, unsteadily, on the belief that leaders will place the interests of the country above their own.To soothe his ego and avoid his insecurities, Trump has refused time and again to take the basic precautions recommended by public health professionals, dismissing masks and social distancing as the stuff of sissies. Ego and insecurity, though, explains only part of Trump’s problem. More fundamental is that from the earliest days of his presidency, his ahistoric and incurious view of the world has led him to misunderstand the very role of a president in a democracy.",5,58,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,tendencias,0.41,919

Fidelity won investments. TurboTax won tax prep. There's no clear winner in mortgage, though, because mortgage hasn't gone all digital yet. The opportunity to win is out there. Today's mortgage experience underperforms. It's tough on home buyers, loan officers, processors, and everyone else. There is a better way to do mortgages. Homebuyer is leading the change. You'll be proud to hang your license here, and I have the bona fides as a loan officer, software engineer, and company founder to lead you to everything we promise.I know that every great loan officer has a full pipeline today. It's hard to sell a switch when the going's this good. But, the best MLOs play the long game.Homebuyer is backed by Novus Home Mortgage. We lend in 46 states. We sell & service our own loans. Our benefits rock. And, pricing? :chef's kiss:But that's just table stakes.You should earn more money per loan. You should spend less time per closing. You should have a life outside your work.

Still can feel how exhausted I was.Thing is, we had one player go down.But not because of injury.Because he feigned an injury to get out of the session.Everyone knew it.Our coach let him go from the camp immediately.And it took some serious convincing for the player to make his way back to the squad.Now, he was one of our best players, and already one of the best in the world at his position.Any of you who follow soccer would likely recognize him.To his credit, and I admire this greatly, he came back a different player. On a mission.He went on to play for the full US National Team, and at some top clubs in the English Premier League.But our coach didn’t hesitate. He sent a very clear message to all of us.He wouldn’t compromise our values. For anyone.See, you can’t treat anyone differently on the team, or let some get away with things that others can’t.Don’t care if it is a top performer. Doesn’t matter.You do that, you lose credibility. Fast.DM me if interested in guessing who this player was.#leader #values",2,43,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,negocios,0.45,1249

And you rightly do not talk about hydrogen fuel cells for the transport sector with their low efficiency and the 3 times higher energy demand compared to EVs. Synthetic fuels which are also highly energy intensive to produce will - even fully scaled up - remain very expensive but will be needed in transportation which can’t be electrified like planes.In my personal view,would be better to go ahead with motor racing:F1 becoming CO2 neutral using synthetic fuels is much more excitement,fun,racing experience,tech-competition than Formula E driving a few laps in city centers in gaming mode.All of this only makes sense if we get carbon-free electricity soon.

Each major operation thus far, from cryo load to engine acceptance testing, has been *so much faster and smoother* this time around.This week in particular is really exciting for us. For the very first time in our company’s short history, customers have arrived in Long Beach to get their payloads processed for launch! While they’re on-site, we’ll work with each team to complete a final round of checkouts.Pretty soon, we’ll bring everything we need for launch — rocket, payloads and ground support equipment — up to Mojave Air and Space Port. There, like before, we’ll turn a bare taxiway into our launch site, and prepare for our adventure to orbit.Check out our latest blog for a more thorough update from our team!  https://virg.in/aJY",17,552,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,negocios,0.52,1014

Jeff Weiner,10813670,"This is one of best leadership courses I have ever attended, Thanks! Jeff Weiner. It’s a complete package of real life scenarios, proven principles, and most importantly enchanting executive presence. I highly recommend this course.Here are a few things that stood out to me.  1) Be mindful, a spectator of your own thoughts.2) Listen with an intent to understand, speak with an intent to be understood.3) Loved the “opinion, suggestion, mandate” framework.4) Strategy - Don’t play the game by somebody else’s rules, beat the competition by being yourself.5) Inspire excellence (demanding is easy but difficult to achieve in the long run).6) More is harder when it comes to focusing and scaling organizations.7) Strongly establish the bull’s eye before venturing into other growth areas.8) Strike the right balance between overcommunication and communication overload.9) Understand and use the power of ‘d’ in RAPIDs to empower your teams not to micromanage.10) Buffer to Brainstorm — use unscheduled times to think and connect the dots.11) Start with what inspires you.12) It’s all about your energy — this course was a perfect example of high passion delivered.#leadership https://lnkd.in/g2reVmK",4,74,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,3,negocios,0.5,1198

The benefits are myriad in terms of … improving [children’s] sense of self, their self-esteem and the way they relate to others.”If you or your organisation is interested in supporting the teaching of compassion in primary schools across the UK, we’d love to hear from you.

I listened to a podcast where Brené Brown talked about how being vulnerable is crucial for innovation. People must have permission to fail without losing their trust.And, as said in this article, ”Creating an environment where there is fear, anxiety, and lack of trust makes people shut down”. ”Compassion and curiosity increase loyalty and trust”.I’ve failed some times in the past on this. I've let my negative emotions about work get in the way of team relationships.

It forces me to be a great listener while also being a great problem solver.However, it’s a completely different story when we try to be self-compassionate.That’s hard work.It’s something I’ve struggled with for a long time. I hold myself to a high standard, and when I feel as if that high standard isn’t met, I judge and ridicule myself. Once I get going, it’s hard to snap out of that line of thinking.

Jeff Weiner,10813670,"Jeff Weiner says compassion is empathy plus action.This definition is one I love and use daily. It forces me to be a great listener while also being a great problem solver.However, it’s a completely different story when we try to be self-compassionate.That’s hard work.It’s something I’ve struggled with for a long time. I hold myself to a high standard, and when I feel as if that high standard isn’t met, I judge and ridicule myself. Once I get going, it’s hard to snap out of that line of thinking.

Jeff Weiner,10813670,"Why I Changed my LinkedIn Profile PicRecently, I took a long hard look at my LinkedIn profile photo – the woman staring back at me had newly highlighted hair and a fresh cut, a pressed blazer, a hint of a smile that showed just the right amount of teeth to let you know she was serious but could be lighthearted when needed. I remember standing in my power pose as my husband snapped the photos. We poured through about 80 shots before we found the one that looked perfectly polished. But the person I was exuding then is not always who I am, and certainly, not who I am right now.  Today’s remote world has blurred the lines between my professional and personal selves, so I’ve chosen to represent that in my photo. Barely dried hair, comfy pullover, ripped jeans - slightly frazzled from having just gotten 3 kids ready for ""school"" - but smiling and ready for work.I’ve witnessed and read enough on authentic leadership to know that being genuine and vulnerable will get you a lot farther in your career than a glossy headshot.",19,257,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,tendencias,0.48,1030

I’m so happy I met her & we are friends till this day. We did a #LinkedInLive earlier this year, link in comments.I recall wanting to delete the post. I started feeling out of place. No one was doing this publicly. People were posting successes & here I was.Then, Jeff engaged & the post went viral. This brought employers, recruiters, supporters, prayer warriors etc.Three months later I landed an internship.#Microsoft folks viewed the post most, my internship was w/ Microsoft & 3 years later I work at Microsoft full time.Why I post this?When you see an #OpenToWork or #jobsearch post, do not pass it by - engage. It really helps.Ryan told me, “#OpenToWork - to harness the power of the community to connect talent with opportunity. There has never been a more important time to help your community.” Joy, Jeff & thousand others engaged with my post & supported me & still do till this day. That’s why I do the same for others.

In my own eyes, I was no professional, had achieved nothing and had no business being here, pretending to be somebody I clearly was not. . . LinkedIn was for high-achievers and I definitely didn't fit my own interpretation of a high-achiever. At the time, I was just a law student in her 2nd year of Uni who didn't even own a CV! As you can imagine, I felt about as phoney as Prince Ali of Ababwa in Disney's Aladdin.But real magic happened the instant I decided to OWN my #process, to silence self-doubt and be more intentional about putting myself out more this year.

Ray Dalio,1818508,"Having a hierarchy of merit is not only consistent with an idea meritocracy but essential for it. It’s simply not possible for everyone to debate everything all the time and still get their work done. Treating all people equally is more likely to lead away from truth than toward it. But at the same time, all views should be considered in an open-minded way, though placed in the proper context of the experiences and track records of the people expressing them. Imagine if a group of us were getting a lesson in how to play baseball from Babe Ruth, and someone who’d never played the game kept interrupting him to debate how to swing the bat. Would it be helpful or harmful to the group’s progress to ignore their different track records and experience? Of course it would be harmful and plain silly to treat their points of view equally, because they have different levels of believability. The most productive approach would be to allow Ruth to give his instructions uninterrupted and then take some time afterward to answer questions.

Ray Dalio,1818508,"In most organizations, evaluations run in only one direction, with the manager assessing the managee. The managee typically disagrees with the assessment, especially if it is worse than his or her self-assessment, because most people believe themselves to be better than they really are. Managees also have opinions about managers that they wouldn’t dare bring up in most companies, so misunderstandings and resentments fester. This perverse behavior undermines the effectiveness of the environment and the relationships between people. It can be avoided by getting in sync in a high-quality way. Your reports have to believe that you’re not their enemy—that your sole goal is to move toward the truth; that you are trying to help them and so will not enable their self-deception, perpetuate a lie, or let them off the hook. This has to be done in an honest and transparent way, because if someone believes they are being pigeonholed unfairly the process won’t work. As equal partners, it is up to both of you to get to the truth.

Yet alignment can never be taken for granted because people are wired so differently. We all see ourselves and the world in our own unique ways, so deciding what’s true and what to do about it takes constant work.Alignment is especially important in an idea meritocracy, so at Bridgewater we try to attain alignment consciously, continually, and systematically. We call this process of finding alignment “getting in sync,” and there are two primary ways it can go wrong: cases resulting from simple misunderstandings and those stemming from fundamental disagreements. Getting in sync is the process of open-mindedly and assertively rectifying both types.To see this principle in action, check out this week's Case of the Week: https://lnkd.in/gpXzRwv#principleoftheday",24,1408,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,responsabilidad social,0.57,1009

A few days later I heard him chatting away at length about stuff that wasn't related to work, so I warned him about the cost to his and our development if he regularly wasted time. Afterward I learned that he thought he was on the brink of being fired. My comment about his need for focus had nothing to do with my overall evaluation.

Putting comfort ahead of success produces worse results for everyone. I both loved the people I worked with and pushed them to be great, and I expected them to do the same with me. From the very beginning, I felt that the people I worked with at Bridgewater were a part of my extended family. When they or members of their families got sick, I put them in touch with my personal doctor to make sure that they were well taken care of. I invited all of them to stay at my house in Vermont on weekends and loved it when they took me up on it. I celebrated their marriages and the births of their children with them and mourned the losses of their loved ones. But to be clear, this was no lovefest. We were tough on each other too, so we could all be as great as we could be. I learned that the more caring we gave each other, the tougher we could be on each other, and the tougher we were on each other, the better we performed and the more rewards there were for us to share.

From when I was ten years old until I was eighteen, Lombardi was head coach of the Green Bay Packers. With limited resources, he led his team to ﬁve NFL championships. He won two NFL Coach of the Year awards and many still call him the best coach of all time. Lombardi loved his players and he pushed them to be great. I admired, and still admire, how uncompromising his standards were. His players, their fans, and he himself all beneﬁted from his approach.

Ray Dalio,1818508,"Most training comes from doing and getting in sync about performance. Feedback should reflect what is succeeding and what is not in proportion to the actual situation, rather than in an attempt to balance compliments and criticisms. Remember that you are responsible for achieving your goals, and you want your machine to function as intended. For it to do so, the employees you supervise must meet expectations, and only you can help them understand whether they are stacking up. As their strengths and weaknesses become clearer, responsibilities can be more appropriately tailored to make the machine work better and to facilitate personal evolution.To see this principle in action, check out this week's Case of the Week: https://lnkd.in/g2uRih4#principleoftheday",179,5751,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,2,responsabilidad social,0.86,766
Ray Dalio,1818508,"Accurate feedback, especially about mistakes and weaknesses, provided in a non-hierarchical way and openly shown is a powerful force for improvement and team building. It is also extremely rare, so it is a great path to gaining a big competitive advantage for those who can do it. I know that it was key to Bridgewater and I's success.

Ray Dalio,1818508,"You've heard the expression “no pain no gain.” Psychologists have shown that the most powerful personal transformations come from experiencing the pain from mistakes that a person never wants to have again—known as “hitting bottom.” So don't be hesitant to give people those experiences or have them yourself. While it is important to be clear to people about what they are doing well, it is even more important to point out their weaknesses and have them reflect on them. Problems require more time than things that are going well. They must be identified and understood and addressed, while things that are running smoothly require less attention. Instead of celebrating how great we are, we focus on where we need to improve, which is how we got to be so great.To see this principle in action, check out this week's Case of the Week: https://lnkd.in/g2uRih4#principleoftheday",51,478,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,negocios,0.65,878

Ray Dalio,1818508,"Everyone has his or her own principles and values, so all relationships entail a certain amount of negotiation or debate over how people should be with each other. What you learn about each other will either draw you together or drive you apart. If your principles are aligned and you can work out your differences via a process of give-and-take, you will draw closer together. If not, you will move apart. Open discussion of differences ensures that there are no misunderstandings. If that doesn’t happen on an ongoing basis, gaps in perspective will widen until inevitably there is a major clash.To see this principle in action, check out this week's Case of the Week: https://lnkd.in/gJpjJmn#principleoftheday",217,8135,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,tendencias,0.47,712
Ray Dalio,1818508,"The most meaningful relationships are achieved when you and others can speak openly to each other about everything that's important, learn together, and understand the need to hold each other accountable to be as excellent as you can be. When you have such relationships with those you work with, you pull each other through challenging times; at the same time, sharing challenging work draws you closer and strengthens your relationships.

Ray Dalio,1818508,"If you're like most people, the idea of facing the unvarnished truth makes you anxious. To get over that, you need to understand intellectually why untruths are scarier than truths and then, through practice, get accustomed to living with them.If you're sick, it’s natural to fear your doctor’s diagnosis—what if it’s cancer or some other deadly disease? As scary as the truth may turn out to be, you will be better off knowing it in the long run because it will allow you to seek the most appropriate treatment. The same holds for learning painful truths about your own strengths and weaknesses. Knowing and acting on the truth is what we call the “big deal” at Bridgewater.

Because these areas of your brain are not accessible to your conscious awareness, it is virtually impossible for you to understand what they want and how they control you. They oversimplify things and react instinctively. They crave praise and respond to criticism as an attack, even when the higher-level parts of the brain understand that constructive criticism is good for you.

Ray Dalio,1818508,"You must be willing to do things in the unique ways you think are best – and to open-mindedly reflect on the feedback that comes inevitably as a result of being that way.Learning to be radically transparent is like learning to speak in public: while it’s initially awkward, the more you do it, the more comfortable you will be with it. This has been true for me. For example, I still instinctively find being as radically transparent in the ways that I am in my book uncomfortable because I am exposing personal material to the public that will attract attention and criticism. Yet I am doing it because I’ve learned that it’s best, and I wouldn't feel good about myself if I let my fears stand in the way. In other words, I have experienced the positive effects of radical transparency for so long that it’s now uncomfortable for me not to be that way.Besides giving me the freedom to be me, it has allowed me to understand others and for them to understand me, which is much more efficient and much more enjoyable than not having this understanding. Imagine how many fewer misunderstandings we would have and how much more efficient the world would be—and how much closer we all would be to knowing what’s true—if instead of hiding what they think, people shared it openly.#principleoftheday",25,562,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,responsabilidad social,0.49,1293

What they fail to see is how much better off they’d be if they raised their chances even more (you can almost always improve your odds of being right by doing things that will give you more information). The expected value gain from raising the probability of being right from 51 percent to 85 percent (i.e., by 34 percentage points) is seventeen times more than raising the odds of being right from 49 percent (which is probably wrong) to 51 percent (which is only a little more likely to be right). Think of the probability as a measure of how often you’re likely to be wrong. Raising the probability of being right by 34 percentage points means that a third of your bets will switch from losses to wins.

There are at least three kinds of learning that foster evolution: memory-based learning (storing the information that comes in through one’s conscious mind so that we can recall it later); subconscious learning (the knowledge we take away from our experiences that never enters our conscious minds, though it affects our decision making); and “learning” that occurs without thinking at all, such as the changes in DNA that encode a species’ adaptations. I used to think that memory-based, conscious learning was the most powerful, but I’ve since come to understand that it produces less rapid progress than experimentation and adaptation. #principleoftheday",130,3959,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,responsabilidad social,0.83,800
Ray Dalio,1818508,"Teams should operate like those in professional sports, where different skills are required to play different positions. Excellence in each is mandatory, the success of the mission is uncompromisable, and members that don’t measure up may need to be cut. When teams operate with such high standards and shared values, extraordinary relationships are likely to develop.#principleoftheday",130,3959,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,tendencias,0.58,386
Ray Dalio,1818508,Intentional distortions to attract readers and viewers through sensationalism that harms others is one of the great diseases that is undermining the health of our country. This is a case that affected Bridgewater that I had a window into which I’d like to pass along to you as an example of what it looks like.,117,4425,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,negocios,0.44,310
Ray Dalio,1818508,"Understanding what is true is essential for success, and being radically transparent about everything, including mistakes and weaknesses, helps create the understanding that leads to improvements. That’s not just a theory; we have put this into practice at Bridgewater for over forty years, so we know how it works. But like most things in life, being radically truthful and transparent has cons as well as pros, which I will describe as accurately as possible.Being radically truthful and transparent with your colleagues and expecting your colleagues to be the same with you ensures that important issues are apparent instead of hidden. It also enforces good behavior and good thinking, because when you have to explain yourself, everyone can openly assess the merits of your logic. If you are handling things well, radical transparency will make that clear, and if you are handling things badly, radical transparency will make that clear as well, so it helps to maintain high standards.Radical truth and radical transparency are fundamental to having a real idea meritocracy. The more people can see what is happening—the good, the bad, and the ugly—the more eﬀective they are at deciding the appropriate ways of handling things. #principleoftheday",117,4425,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,negocios,0.64,1251
Ray Dalio,1818508,"Doing that sustains their evolution. In the case of Bridgewater, we do that by having an idea meritocracy that strives for meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical truth and radical transparency. By meaningful work, I mean work that people are excited to get their heads into, and by meaningful relationships I mean those in which there is genuine caring for each other (like an extended family). I find that these reinforce each other and that being radically truthful and radically transparent with each other makes both the work and the relationship go better. #principleoftheday",83,3821,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,responsabilidad social,0.8,602

Ray Dalio,1818508,"Having a hierarchy of merit is not only consistent with an idea meritocracy but essential for it. It’s simply not possible for everyone to debate everything all the time and still get their work done. Treating all people equally is more likely to lead away from truth than toward it. But at the same time, all views should be considered in an open-minded way, though placed in the proper context of the experiences and track records of the people expressing them. Imagine if a group of us were getting a lesson in how to play baseball from Babe Ruth, and someone who’d never played the game kept interrupting him to debate how to swing the bat. Would it be helpful or harmful to the group’s progress to ignore their diﬀerent track records and experience? Of course it would be harmful and plain silly to treat their points of view equally, because they have diﬀerent levels of believability. The most productive approach would be to allow Ruth to give his instructions uninterrupted and then take some time afterward to answer questions. #principleoftheday",96,3069,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,tendencias,0.43,1056
Ray Dalio,1818508,"Be audacious. There is always a best possible path. Your job is to ﬁnd it and have the courage to follow it. What you think is attainable is just a function of what you know at the moment. Once you start your pursuit you will learn a lot, especially if you triangulate with others; paths you never saw before will emerge.  Of course there are some impossibilities or near-impossibilities, such as playing center on a professional basketball team if you’re short, or running a four-minute mile at age seventy.#principleoftheday",123,5144,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,responsabilidad social,0.66,526
Ray Dalio,1818508,"The most meaningful relationships are achieved when you and others can speak openly to each other about everything that's important, learn together, and understand the need to hold each other accountable to be as excellent as you can be.

What would crafting a commitment equal to this promise mean for our communities, for higher education, and for society?I've been thinking deeply about these questions (as asking the right question can lead to surprising answers!) at the start of a new decade - hopeful that we can all do the work that is necessary to engage deep, meaningful, and pervasive institutional transformation. I'm looking forward to being a more active contributor this year on LinkedIn, and to share what I'm learning about what it would take to reduce the barriers to mobility. I'm eager to learn more about the good work that is being done, where we can begin to build on that work and more clearly define what student success means beyond graduation, and how higher education can live up to its potential as an engine of opportunity.

We have a cool program here where employees get an incremental bonus every five years to donate to a single #charity. That includes me! So, I met Doug Baldwin Jr at Seattle Seahawks training camp in 2018. His charisma engaged my team and his curiosity surprised me. He asked great questions and one, in particular, was whether I'd support a community center he was building in Renton. I asked him to tell me more.This video pretty much sums up what we discussed.There are many other great charities that I will be giving to this season and throughout the year, but it’s The Family First Community Center in City of Renton where I’m donating my 5-year gift!I’ve been lucky in life, and I was raised to believe I should share good fortune with those lacking similar opportunities.

Jim Yong Kim,2092899,"The Power of Honesty: Why Being Straightforward Matters.Why do leaders have such a hard time being honest?Pride can cause people to be less straightforward. Ego is a serious problem in a lot of organizations. Too often, senior leaders don’t acknowledge their problems. And when they do, they hide them. “How can I tell others that I have a problem with that? They won’t respect me. They will think I’m weak.” So often it is pride that discourages us from saying, “I don’t know.” When I am asked a difficult question about quality, and I don’t have an answer, it is incumbent on me to admit, “I don’t know.” I can imagine people thinking, “What the heck? You are supposed to be the quality expert.” And I am. But I am not omniscient.

Yet half the world’s population – 3.5 billion people – don’t have access to essential health services, and 100 million people are pushed into extreme poverty every year because of health expenses. Universal Health Coverage is critical to meet our goals of ending extreme poverty and increasing shared prosperity. Good health is not only essential for the well-being of every person on earth, it’s fundamental to healthy and productive economies. On #UHCDay, we join the call for stronger, more equitable health systems that leave no one behind. The only way that we will actually bring healthcare to every person, everywhere in the world, is if we fundamentally change the system so that governments and people demand more investments in health. #HealthforAll",388,2607,1,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,responsabilidad social,0.6,863

Host China was among them and rose 32 spots to rank 46th out of 190 economies. Our Doing Business and Human Capital Indexes have taught us that regardless how complex an area is, it can be measured—and that measuring and ranking economies promotes accountability, transparency and reform. While no one size fits all for business regulation reforms, countries that do well in our Doing Business Index share certain features: strong leadership, long-term vision, proactive action planning, systematic results tracking, communicating achievements, and extensive engagement with the private sector.  Given the accelerating pace of reform, countries are increasingly fostering an environment where entrepreneurs and small and medium enterprises can thrive -- which is essential to ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity around the world.

This course aims at helping people build mental resilience and improve emotional well-being to navigate the increased stress so many of us experiencing right now.We ended up talking about mental issues and I shared my own story of burnout and what I was doing outside of work on the topic to help others.The call ended and someone pinged me to thank me as he had been in denial for too long, was never happy in life. He said something that stuck with me: “If you can, I would say never stop what you are doing. Maybe it will not resonate with everyone but with those who it does it can make a big change.”The same day I attended an online webinar about stress relief with great content about stress hormones, etc. The speaker then talked about the importance of gratitude and the power of giving. It immediately clicked and thought about that comment in the morning.Yes talking about Burnout is not fun but as long as my story can help even one person, then I will take it as my mission in life.#Burnout #Thriving",13,41,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,responsabilidad social,0.55,1218

Tony Robbins,6104765,"We’re teaming up with Operation Underground Railroad and Love Grenades to help make an even bigger impact in our mission to #endchildtrafficking. Our friends at Love Grenades just launched their “Sound of Freedom” dog tag necklace.Here’s why: Years ago, during a raid, OUR founder, Tim Ballard rescued a 5-year-old boy and his 12-year old sister from the horrors of sex slavery. While at the crime scene, the little boy gave Tim an old dog tag that Tim later learned had been a gift from his sister to her little brother in a symbol of hope — a joint prayer that one day they would be rescued. The young boy asked Tim to keep it and to this day, the dog tag is a symbol of his promise and mission to rescue enslaved children throughout the world.For every Sound of Freedom dog tag purchased, $50 will directly benefit OUR and help to support their life-saving work. That means, for every 30 tags sold, we can rescue one child from sex trafficking, and provide the aftercare services they need.The #FreedomDogTag is a symbol for all who wear it. Our message to the world is that we, too, will continue fighting for their rescue, because all those children trafficked and enslaved are not forgotten.

Tony Robbins,6104765,"We can get better results with ourselves and others by asking better questions. One proven strategy is to use an OUTCOME FRAME. If you ask someone, ""What’s bothering you?"" or ""What’s wrong?"" you’ll usually get a lengthy dissertation on just that, THE PROBLEM.But if you ask them, “What do you want?” or “How do you want to change things?” you’ve redirected the conversation FROM THE PROBLEM, TO THE SOLUTION.In any situation, no matter how dismal, there’s a desirable outcome to be achieved. 👉Your goal should be to change direction TOWARD THE DESIRED SOLUTION and AWAY FROM THE PROBLEM. Do this by asking the right questions.   Here’s one more important frame... Don’t ask your kid WHY he is having trouble with his algebra. Ask him WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO to perform better.“Why” questions can get us explanations, justifications, and excuses. Good communicators aren’t interested in rationalizing why something is going WRONG.

Speak up, be willing to look ridiculous, you’ve got the ideas inside of you, write your own patent, and go for it. I had no idea what I was doing. When I got my idea I went to the Georgia Institute of Technology library everyday after work for a week and looked up every pantyhose patent since the 1800’s on their microfiche. I then went to Barnes & Noble, Inc. and bought a book on patents and trademarks. I wrote my own patent, my mom drew the sketch of the product idea (the original footless pantyhose) and I was the model in the sketch. I had a lawyer write just the “claims” for a discounted fee and bam 💥 I got the official patent number two years later and I was an inventor!

In 2010, LinkedIn was often misunderstood as the “Lincoln” car dealership (by many people but esp my dad who has finally figured out the difference).  In other words, it was less of an obvious choice.  But what was obvious back then and still now, is the company is deeply rooted in a set of values that have guided the people it hires, the culture it nurtures and the millions of small and big business decisions we make every day. And while I did feel very privileged to join the company 10 years ago, every day since this feeling has become more pronounced for two reasons:My job.  I cannot imagine a job that more perfectly aligns with my personal values and what matters most in the world: ensuring that two people with equal talent have equal access to opportunity.

I had never even taken a business class. Because I had no idea how it was supposed to be done, I kept it as simple as possible. I focused on 3 things: Make it, sell it, build awareness. I made the product, sold it to as many stores as I could and spent the rest of my time building excitement and awareness. Then I would repeat the cycle. That’s it! I see a lot of entrepreneurs with really great ideas freeze in their tracks because of their “lack of experience” or knowledge. But what you “don’t” know could be the very thing that sets you apart from all the rest. Follow your purpose. Lead with your story.

I can’t think of a time in our country’s history where “living the truth of our values” hasn’t been considered dangerous and radical.  I was in the political social work concentration in grad school and we often talked about the differences between being agents of control and agents of change. I’m starting to wonder if hook’s concept of a “love ethic” isn’t one of the big variables that differentiates control (keep it comfortable and palatable) and real change (reimagine and rebuild the system). #loveisradical",448,16420,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,negocios,0.61,874

Larry Fink,777306,"I was in Riyadh last week talking about foreign investment in Saudi Arabia. Like other global corporations, we represent clients around the world looking to invest there and have clients living in Saudi Arabia looking to invest abroad. Global companies operating in Saudi Arabia today often want to operate under the radar or avoid talking about their business there. I believe just the opposite. Corporate leaders should be having a public dialogue about it. Not because everything in Saudi Arabia is perfect – but precisely because everything is not.I believe greater economic integration and diversification will help Saudi Arabia build a more modern and sustainable economy and society for all of its citizens. I also believe that corporate engagement and public dialogue can help with that evolution. The murder of Jamal Khashoggi was horrifying. There is much Saudi Arabia needs to do to demonstrate that it is truly committed to reforms that strengthen the rule of law and the rights of all of its people. As I have said repeatedly to Saudi leaders, for Saudi Arabia to be on the world stage, it must act like a world leader. If the country can continue on that path, I believe it can play an even more important role in the global economy and create a brighter future for its citizens.",24,376,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,negocios,0.63,1293

It’s an incredible organization — it works swiftly, in dangerous places, and it helps people rebuild their lives. That’s maybe what I admire most about the I.R.C. Its approach is built on the idea that displaced persons cannot be consigned to hopelessness — that, like anyone else, they are families trying to work, send their kids to school and build futures. That kind of empathy is what’s needed to solve this crisis, and I’m proud to support the I.R.C.",32,1231,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,responsabilidad social,0.57,883

When I look at her, I see my mother, my grandmothers and all the other women who came before her who made it possible for her to have a future filled with possibilities.

Sara Blakely,973636,"I’ll never forget where I was when I heard that Princess Diana was critically injured in a car accident in Paris. It was the end of August 1997, and I was at our home in Millbrook, New York. My husband, Jay, was in the middle of his battle with colon cancer, and it was an incredibly stressful time. When the news broke, I spent hours glued to the TV in our family room, waiting for any bit of information. I was so upset and holding my breath like the rest of the world. But eventually, Brian Williams announced she had died. I was devastated. I hopped on a plane to cover the funeral. Although I was reporting on what was going on, I too was mourning Princess Diana. Now, 23 years after that tragic car accident, Diana is preserved in our memories: young, vibrant, and still figuring out who she was as she entered a new, exciting and probably nerve-racking period in her life. So much lost potential, but so many indelible images of a woman — loving her boys and finding her purpose, as well as herself. And in death, as in life, inspiring all of us to do the same. #rememberingprincessdiana #princessdi",65,1122,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,negocios,0.79,1106

Sara Blakely,973636,"It's Women's Equality Day, and I had no idea this existed (thank you Sara Blakely for bringing it to my attention). I grew up with strong women so the idea of needing a women's equality day was foreign to me growing up.  My grandmother was a powerful influence.  She was a single parent of two head strong boys, a journalist, and a true southern lady.  She never once allowed me to feel less than anyone.  I was told at a young age I could be anything- a chef, a veterinarian, a writer.  I was not given a limitation.  That is not to say I have not felt the double standards or seen inequality in the work place.  I think most of the women I know have stories about being treated differently simply based on gender.The good news is I have seen a shift in women supporting women!  And when we band together and shatter stereotypes and applaud our success, we all win.Happy Women's Equality day do all the amazing women that get up and make the world a better place!#womensequalityday # #equality #diversity",226,7153,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,tendencias,0.72,1005
Sara Blakely,973636,"Happy #WomensEqualityDay. Thank you to the women and men who came before me who fought for equal rights, and for the ones who made it possible for me and so many others to pursue our own dreams. The original Wonder Woman TV show came out in 1975 when I was 4 years old. I remember being in awe of Lynda Carter because she didn’t need to be saved… she was the one doing the saving. I thought... ""Women can be superheroes?"" In the 1970s, women still had very limited options – I watched my own Mother and Grandmothers never really get the chance to fulfill their full potential. It motivated me to do everything in my power to fulfill my own potential on behalf of those who weren’t given the chance. Thank you to my mom for making this Wonder Woman Halloween costume! I remember you cutting and sewing each star, sewing the Wonder Woman top to my turtle neck so I wouldn’t be cold, the tin foil arm cuffs that kept coming off, and the head band I was so excited to wear I didn’t wait for the glue to dry and it stuck in my hair. It meant everything to me and I was truly transformed. Women really are superheroes, especially moms. #WomensEqualityDay",4,89,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,tendencias,0.64,1148

Beth Comstock,869688,"Ecomagination was GE’s multi-billion dollar brand makeover. It was a bold initiative to move a company considered to be an environmental dinosaur from the industrial age into a new era.  At the time, my guest on Ecosystems' #VoiceofValue #podcast, Beth Comstock, was the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) at GE. Beth was at the forefront of helping to create a new 21st Century value proposition.  In this clip, Beth talks about conducting “dreaming sessions with customers."" A brave, collaborative effort to co-create value with customers. GE and their customers worked together to design the right ecological and economical solution.   Ecomagination was one of GE’s most successful business initiatives having generated over $160 billion in revenue for the company. #ValueMadeClear How are you dreaming forward with your customers?",17,111,0,0,1,1,1,3,1,1,tendencias,0.53,829

Beth Comstock,869688,"“Change — in your career, in your company, in your life — starts with YOU. You have to imagine a future that others can’t yet see, and take the initial steps to make it real. Give yourself permission — Then pass it on!” - Beth ComstockI’ve been a long-time fan of Beth Comstock — and having just finished her book, “Imagine It Forward,” it’s even clearer to me why. Beth describes her life as a continuous process of  DISCOVERY. She says: “Open yourself up to be an apprentice, finding a ‘master craftperson’ to study under. Seek out the best in the field; take a key element of wisdom from each one, and then find a way to make it your own.” This was the approach Beth took when she became a first time CMO at GE. She read text books, connected with experts  — and, only after learning the fundamentals from peers, did she decide to break the mold: Building GE’s first “innovation/incubation engine,” rather than a traditional marketing function. Instinctively, this is the approach I took in building WeWork’s Central Growth Team. I spoke with more than a dozen Heads of Growth at exponential peer companies and, only then, did we build our team — recasting the Growth OS to suit the world’s fastest growing physical, social network.

Migration on the scale we are likely to face will not only devastate many areas, it will create intense pressures on those locations whose climate becomes more temperate or is less badly affected. Integrating migrants into existing cities will in some cases revitalize those cities; in other places, they will severely tax infrastructure. At worst, there will be warfare as countries try to keep desperate migrants from entering. If we want to get ahead of this, we should think about how to shape ""the market"" so that there is equitable opportunity for those forced to move, rather than leaving them in ""temporary"" shantytowns for decades. #climatechange #migration",19,124,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,tendencias,0.61,942

Research shows that “extremely hot summers” are 200 times more likely than they were 50 years ago. But unless you’re considerably older than 50, you probably don’t feel the change. David Roberts describes ‘“shifting baselines syndrome”—a sort of generational amnesia that allows us to forget what we lost and adjust to what we have. It’s a useful psychological trait, but when confronting vast, slow-moving disasters like #climatechange  or #pandemic, it can lead to inaction and complacency. We can counteract that tendency by shifting our culture from one focused on meeting our own materialist desires to one that values historical consciousness—a day-to-day awareness of the obligations that come with being a good ancestor, says Roberts.

It is impossible to understand how experts arrive at their advice, or how leaders use it wisely, apart from the exercise of judgment. Though we might think this point is obvious, it is belied by the common image of science as a neutral, even godlike encounter with eternal, capital-T Truth.

Tax windows and you'll get dark houses, as Britain discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries; tax employees and you head for a jobless economy, as many countries are discovering today. It is happening in part thanks to the 20th century's legacy of perverse tax policies, which charge firms for hiring humans (through payroll taxes), subsidize them for buying robots (through tax deductible capital investments), and levy next to nothing on the use of land and non-renewable resources. In 2012, over 50% of tax revenue in the UEU came from taxing labor; in the United States, the percentage was even higher. It is no surprise that the industry's response has been to focus on increasing labor productivity - output per worker - by replacing as many workers as possible with automatons.""

It’s listening to the others around you playing their own instruments, it’s knowing that they’re doing something different than you, but when you come together, you’re producing something you couldn’t have done by yourself… That if you remember, there’s an audience, there’s an intention, there’s a reason for you to be with these people to connect to each other to produce something that you couldn’t have done by yourself into an impact and to have a result...

They are neither courageous nor wise.  How is it that they have enslaved me?...For as long as space endures and for as long as the world lasts, may I live to dispel the suffering of the world.”——I recall Richard Gere visiting us at the Tibetan Childrens Village (TCV) in Dharamsala, India.  TCV is a school for Tibetan refugees which I attended. Richard met with a number of us with much love and respect. He told us how important it is to preserve our culture and the relevance of it in our world. As an economically poor and politically marginalized refugee his words were encouraging but I did not fully appreciate it. Fast forward I now serve on the board of The Tibet Fund based here in New York City. I work with Richard and others to raise funds and resources to preserve Tibetan culture.  While greatly appreciating modern political and economic system there is no doubt in my mind the value and relevance of our culture to contribute to a more kinder, equitable, sustainable and flourishing world.   #compassion #stewardship #inclusiveness #interdependenceMollie Rodriguez",0,23,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,1,negocios,0.75,1235

Jeffrey Walker,102536,"At the time of death what will best allow us to face it is not the size of the deal we worked on or even how much positive impact we had, but how best we tried to serve others. This is the conclusion I have drawn from my father. His body continues to deteriorate due to his age. When I ask how he is doing, he tells me he is very happy. When I prod him further he tells me that he has no regrets because he tried his best. This is great news because it means we ALL have the same opportunity no matter how powerful or rich we are. Let me give you a glimpse of his journey. In March 1959, my father was a staff person work closely with His Holiness the Dalai Lama. He stayed behind, along with a number of others, to create a sense of normalcy so that the Dalai Lama could escape to India. Later, he sought refuge in India and dedicated his life to preserve a culture that promoted mental qualities of love and compassion. Today top neuroscientists, multi billionaires, renowned educators and a growing number of public are seeing the wisdom of the power of an altruistic motivation. The culture my father and his generation put their life on the line to preserve is now viewed by many as a global treasure and source of hope for a better world.  #stewardship #inclusiveness",3,18,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,negocios,0.58,1273

Jeffrey Walker,102536,"Jeffrey Walker, New Profit's Board Chair, recently co-authored a piece with Katherine Milligan of Bamboo Capital Partners for Stanford Social Innovation Review's ""Centered Self: The Connection Between Inner Well-Being and Social Change"" series.The piece takes a deep look at the pressures associated with social entrepreneurship that often lead to burnout, anxiety, and fatigue and the importance of self-inquiry for these leaders. ""We found that continuous self-inquiry helped leaders manage their energy and resilience, become more effective team leaders, and develop more meaningful collaborations with other organizations to drive sustained, positive change in the way the current individuals, organizations, and governments address problems.""https://hubs.ly/H0plDXZ0",2,21,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,2,tendencias,0.53,771

I'm encouraging all nonprofit leaders and others who care about equity and opportunity to read this piece and share it in their own networks. There are actionable pieces of information throughout, as well as some framing that feels important at this moment of unprecedented challenges:The more we share insights, collaborate, and provide support to each other, the better we'll be able to navigate the hard times ahead.

Jeffrey Walker,102536,"A public health physician who used to work at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for 20 years shared with me the importance of a culture shift in the financial industry:“Highlighting the importance of compassion in the banking and finance sector could significantly influence health system executives, who view health care as a business rather than a vocation or a compassionate mission.  Appeals by health workers for more compassionate health systems seem to carry little weight, but a strong voice and case studies of mindfulness and compassion from banking and finance could be very persuasive.  And health is just one of the many sectors that could be influenced in this way. “While we reflect with gratitude the compassion of our health care professionals, let us expedite our efforts to bring the culture shift in the financial industry so that we have the maximum positive impact on our society.I would like to express my deep appreciation to Dean Sanjeev Khagram from my alma mater Thunderbird School of Global Management  and a number of others who are work hard to envision a world post coronavirus which is driven by a compassionate approach based on inclusivity.  #compassion #stewardship #interdependence #mindfulness #leadership",6,19,0,1,0,0,1,5,1,1,responsabilidad social,0.54,1251
Jeffrey Walker,102536,"While we look to immediate solutions during this global crises let us use this heightened awareness of interdependence to plan for the long term.Teaching our future leaders to approach challenges through a compassionate approach driven by inclusiveness is critical for our planet’s sustainability. The biggest problem stemming from the lack of such an approach is that it increases the chance of us being blindsided. Compassion and competition are not mutually exclusive. A spiritual looking person is not necessarily compassionate and a military person is not violent. Compassion is a state of mind where you wish to alleviate the suffering of others. To illustrate my point, one of my close friends Barbara Barrett is the Secretary of the world’s most powerful Air Force and a successful business person. She is driven by compassion. Earlier Barbara introduced me to Arizona State University President Michael Crow to explore areas of mutual interest. His inclusive approach to education driven to have a positive impact on the world is awe inspiring. ASU was named No. 1 in innovation (5 times) by U.S. News and World Report. I would encourage you to share his approach to your own alma mater as we plan for the future.  #stewardship #compassion #interdependence #inclusiveness",0,17,0,1,0,0,1,4,0,2,negocios,0.43,1280

Jeffrey Walker,102536,"It is exciting to see the growing interest in mindfulness and sustainability among the younger generation.Two colleagues- Lahna Rae Harper and Magdalena Nadar  - requested me to share my thoughts on this subject.   It was mutually inspiring exchanging different stories, perspectives and experiences over lunch. At the end of our lunch, I shared probably the most important lesson I learned from my parents and teachers. —More important than the mindfulness techniques, is the wish to develop yourself to have the maximum positive benefit to others before your practice. An altruistic motivation allows you to see yourself as another sentient being and the preciousness of life.  Secondary factors like our gender, job, ethnicity, wealth etc. are a reality but will not define you once you set your motivation right. With this altruistic wish the anchor of your mind will be lifted and you will sail in a positive direction. How far you sail will depend on your technique and effort. This wish can play a critical role in connecting sustainability and mindfulness so that they can build of each other.  #stewardship #mindfulness #compassion #inclusivity",2,62,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,negocios,0.43,1153

Jeffrey Walker,102536,"Mindfulness — What experiences should you expect when you practice?Experience 1 During the first stage, as you pay attention to the object of meditation it appears that your mind is full of thoughts. Normally we are most aware of the aspect of our mind that is engaged with external sensory items.Keep bringing your attention back to the object of concentration for short periods of time.  The number of your thoughts appears to be more than normal. The reality is that this abundance is always there, but now you are noticing them. The analogy used during this phase is that your mind is like a waterfall.    Just notice your thoughts without pausing and move on. Engagement with your thoughts will fuel your distraction.  Feel encouraged by this observation because it means you are now using the aspect of your mind that is inward focused.  #mindfulness #contemplation #compassion",0,12,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,responsabilidad social,0.63,883
Jeffrey Walker,102536,The synergy resulting from merging ancient mind training techniques to generate compassion and modern economic system will have a transformative positive impact on the world. The two are a natural fit as they complement each other. One releases our mental potential while the other our material potential. The purpose of both systems is to benefit the greater good and they have individually proven to be extremely powerful.At our bank I had the opportunity to share mindfulness and compassion techniques to thousands of colleagues while learning about the intricate world of finance. I am excited to have our next Mindfulness Group luncheon on February 11 to informally share our experiences on banking with compassion. Attendees will include Ric Kay Saad Iqbal John Lilly David S. Miller David Interdonato Jordan Wishnew and Beth Prohow The overall support of our senior leadership and colleagues throughout our organization and outside has been very inspiring.

Jack Welch,7259864,"“The summer of mistakes.” That’s what my wife and daughter labeled the past few months, as they endeavored to get familiar with a newly installed home pottery studio. At first, I’ll admit I kind of bristled at their good humor around what did indeed prove to be a litany of blown-up pots and glaze meltdowns. But then I remembered how often in business I urged my teams to experiment rapidly and boldly, assess and evaluate out loud, and move on quickly – all in the name of learning. We can’t be afraid to fail, because the truth is, failure is often the best teacher – in life and at work. If only we could all be as cheerful about it as Suzy and Eve!

Such was the case at Quadio this summer, where Suzy and I were blown away by the passion, intensity, and sheer creativity of the 22 college students from across the country who literally turned down internships in finance and at major record labels to join an upstart music tech company with a huge dream. These interns laid waste to virtually every claim we’ve ever heard lobbed against Millennials. They were sincere, engaged, and tireless, and we’re more optimistic about the future of business than ever.

Sallie Krawcheck,2625922,"This #FinancialFeministFriday, we’re celebrating Dr. Mabel Ping-Hua Lee, leader in securing the right to vote for women in America. She was born in 1897 in Guangzhou, China, and moved to New York’s Chinatown at age nine. In 1912, at age 16, Dr. Lee helped lead a suffrage parade (on horseback!) attended by almost 10,000 people. The New York Times called her “a symbol of the new era, when all women will be free and unhampered.” The same year, she started studying at Barnard College, and wrote feminist essays arguing that voting rights for women were necessary to a successful democracy. Dr. Lee and other Chinese suffragists fought for this right, even though they didn’t benefit from the 19th Amendment: White women won the right to vote in 1920, but Chinese women weren’t able to vote until 1943 due to the Chinese Exclusion Act, which prevented Chinese immigrants from becoming citizens. After graduating from Barnard, Dr. Lee earned her PhD in economics — the first Chinese woman to do so. She took over for her father as director of the First Chinese Baptist Church of NYC until her death in 1966. It’s unknown whether she was ever able to gain citizenship and exercise her right to vote. Thank you, Dr. Lee, for your instrumental and often unacknowledged activism for ALL women in America.",24,359,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,negocios,0.53,1299

McKinney, the author who started #PublishingPaidMe, a hashtag for white authors to share the amount of their book advances publicly so Black authors and authors of color can compare. Publishing’s systemic biases against Black authors run deep. ""What they’re paid. What the marketing is. How their books are treated. How one Black book not reaching its parameters casts a shadow on all Black books and all Black authors, and that’s not the same for our white counterparts."" #PublishingPaidMe showed just how dramatic the difference can be, and that well-established Black authors earn comparatively smaller advances than unknown white authors with no track record. For example, Roxanne Gay received only $150,000 for her book following the beloved ""Bad Feminist,"" while Mandy Lyn Catron – a white woman with one viral article under her belt – got a $400,000 advance on her debut. The hashtag led to an anonymous spreadsheet where authors can document their advances, and the trend is clear: When publishers decide to give six-figure advances to debut novels, they’re only giving them to white authors.

Zadie recently released a new collection of ultra-timely essays called Intimations, written entirely during lockdown. “Essay is, for me, an attempt at a kind of clarity. I have a very messy and chaotic mind, but when I’m writing an essay I find I can exert a bit more control over it.” Zadie says this book was her “way of doing something … I was stuck with the only thing I can do, which is write. And I suddenly thought of it as a way of participating, of raising money, of being active.” The royalties from Intimations will go to the Equal Justice Initiative and the COVID Emergency Relief Fund for New York. “I wanted to try and give readers the thing I try to fight for myself, which is a space to think your own thoughts, whatever they might be.” Thank you for writing (and sharing) your words with the world, Zadie.Photo: Dominique Nabokov",18,453,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,responsabilidad social,0.47,1213

Sallie Krawcheck,2625922,"This #FinancialFeministFriday, we’re celebrating Rhiana Gunn-Wright, national climate policy expert and co-author of the Green New Deal. For Ms. Gunn-Wright, environmental justice work has always been personal, tied to health problems in her community: She was raised by her mother, grandmother, and extended family on the South Side of Chicago where a disproportionate amount of people — including herself — had asthma. Later in life, she realized it was linked to air pollution in the area. She went on to become a Rhodes Scholar, graduate magna cum laude from Yale, intern for former First Lady Michelle Obama (NBD), and lend her expertise to various campaigns and organizations. In 2018, Ms. Gunn-Wright was recruited by New Consensus to co-author the Green New Deal, a 10-year plan to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions while creating new jobs — which was introduced in Congress by Senator Edward Markey and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “The last time I went home, I visited with my grandmother, Bertha Gunn. She told me: ‘You’re doing the work I always wanted to do. No one would listen to me, but they’re listening to you.’ That makes me happy.” Thank you, Ms. Gunn-Wright, for your work toward (literally) saving the world.For more like this, check out ellevest.com/magazine",1,135,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,responsabilidad social,0.51,1291

Indya stars as Angel Evangelista on ""Pose,"" the barrier-breaking FX series that puts NYC’s Black and Latinx queer communities of the late 80s front and center. It also features more transgender actors than any scripted show in history. ""I can’t fathom the magnitude of inspiration and hope that these stories give trans people and queer people."" Indya was raised a Jehovah's Witness, and their parents weren’t accepting when Indya started showing their feminine self — so at age 14, they left home and entered the foster care system in the Bronx. Indya built up a following on Instagram and started modeling, which eventually led to their audition for ""Pose"" — and when they got the role, they knew their life was going to change. They’ve since reconciled with their mother (who has finally accepted Indya for who they are), become passionate about being a healing voice for marginalized communities, and landed a spot on 2019’s Time 100 Most Influential People list.

Sallie Krawcheck,2625922,"If you’ve developed a TikTok habit since stay-at-home orders went into effect, you're probably familiar with this week’s #FinancialFeministFriday — Tabitha Brown. She’s an actress by trade, but recently became a viral sensation: Tabitha’s daughter convinced her to join TikTok in March to be ""like a mom"" to the platform's primarily teen audience. Since then, her vegan food tutorials and daily affirmation videos have earned her over two million followers. ""So many people are dealing with anxiety and hopelessness during this time. That's why I started."" Unfortunately, she’s all too familiar with this experience. Tabitha went vegan after a long period of illness in 2016, when she woke up with a headache that never went away — causing anxiety, chronic fatigue, and depression.

Sallie Krawcheck,2625922,"This #FinancialFeministFriday, we’re celebrating Maria Antoineta Alva — aka “Toni,” the 35-year-old finance minister of Peru who’s achieved near rockstar-status as a result of her pandemic response. Toni is the daughter of Jorge Alva, rector of the Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería, and was exposed to extreme poverty in Peru when she accompanied him on his travels as a child. She became determined to change things, and went on to graduate with a masters in public administration from Harvard in 2014. Now, she’s the only woman in President Martin Vizcarra’s cabinet. Some questioned Toni’s abilities when she was appointed, claiming she only made it there because of her father — not because of her years of experience. “It’s impossible not to think that was just machismo. If I were a man, that wouldn’t necessarily have been called into question.” She’s currently at the helm of an ambitious coronavirus recovery package that’s winning praise for its aid to small businesses and ordinary citizens. She accomplished this by negotiating with her colleagues for solutions like cash handouts, payroll subsidies, and government-backed business loans, none of which had ever been previously attempted in Peru. Thank you, Toni, for putting your citizens first. We can’t wait to see what you do next.",648,712,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,negocios,0.52,1299

To receive this kind of recognition with products and brands designed for the mass market is not an easy challenge. Often these #awards focus on niche and high end brands and on specific industries and product categories. To create something that is inspiring and breakthrough, that is cool and unique, but that is also able to be understood and appreciated every day by billions of people worldwide, generating every year dozens of billions of $ in sales, is insanely difficult. Everyday we work hard to strike that perfect balance between useful and engaging, functional and beautiful, aspirational and commercially viable. For this achievement I want to thank:- The organizations and the juries behind these awards, for recognizing projects that do not belong to the more traditional categories of design, freeing up design from an old and suffocating definition and enabling our community of designers to touch so many more industries, with a long term positive impact on our society and the planet.

I’m excited to partner with my friends Martin Whittaker and Paul Tudor Jones II at JUST Capital to bring this effort beyond PayPal’s walls. We’re announcing a new initiative to help other companies conduct a Worker Financial Wellness Assessment – something I found was a critical first step to understanding the current financial state of my workforce and how to make tangible, often life-changing improvements.

Ryan Holmes,1727687,"Question: Why does #Walmart (really) want #TikTok? I've got a theory — love to know what folks in the industry think. It's got a few parts: 1) Ecommerce giants like Walmart and Amazon are currently highly dependent on social networks like Facebook to reach an audience and advertise. 2) As social networks become ecomm players in their own right (a la Facebook Shops), a conflict of interest emerges. Traditional ecomm giants risk losing access to their audience if, say, Facebook decides to limit the reach of their ads down the road.  3)  In the long view, building/buying their own social network is the only surefire way for the Walmarts and Amazons of the world to secure access to audiences. 4) Hence, Walmart's interest in TikTok (which is hard to explain otherwise). OK - probably a few holes in that theory, but I wonder if anyone else out there is thinking along the same lines.

You’ll be amazed at what you are capable of achieving. - Read lots of great books. They are a passport to the world and will open your mind to different perspectives. - Watch your thoughts, as they become your words. - Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. They are often the best teachers. - Be bold. Don’t let anyone diminish your voice. - Be respectful. As Michelle Obama so wisely shared, when they go low, you go high. - Be confident. You have more potential than you know. - Be intelligent. Be a sponge for learning and be prepared. You will shine.- Be helpful & a force for good. Many of you will have privilege that others do not. Use that privilege to bring equity where it doesn’t exist today. - Be you. Unabashedly, authentically, you. I invite others to reflect on what they would tell their younger self.

Hans Vestberg,50206,"Being self-aware is one of the most crucial skills a leader should possess in the future of work. The American Management Association did a study of 72 senior executives and found that a high self-awareness score was the strongest predictor of overall success. According to corporate organization psychologist Dr. Becky Winkler, it’s because the leaders who are self-aware of their weaknesses are able to hire people who perform better in the areas where the leaders are lacking. One fascinating aspect of Dr. Winkler’s research found that harsh leaders who are focused on driving results at all costs actually diminish the bottom line instead of improving it. On the other hand, self-aware leaders are able to deliver better financial performance.Hans Vestberg, CEO of Verizon Communications summed up this concept nicely in an interview 👇👇👇Learn from over 140 CEOs like Hans --> http://ow.ly/Ispg50BVbHS#futureofwork #leadership #selfawareness",1,24,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,tendencias,0.56,945

Lots of wisdom here from an amazing leader.""Equality is not something to take for granted. Whenever there is a 'first' for women — be it politics, business, sports, academics — not enough is done to ensure she is the first of many and not out there alone breaking ground. For every step forward, women have felt the pressures of society pushing back — and this year is no different. While a record number of women are leading Fortune 500 companies, we are also seeing many mothers feel pressured to abandon their professional dreams and ambitions in light of the continued impact of the pandemic. Our crisis response as a society cannot be to sacrifice women's contributions and the future of young girls.

From his humble beginnings learning his hard work ethic from his mother, to graduating from West Point and serving our great nation in the Army until he retired as a Colonel in the US Army reserve... to the exceptional leader, mentor, colleague and friend that I know him as at JLL - his drive, determination, leadership and thoughtfulness are attributes that we can all learn from. Everyone that knows Herman, knows that he has always paved the way for others. Especially African Americans, minorities and women. I can attest to how he truly believes in making connections, creating avenues and helping others achieve professional and personal successes. If there is a way for Herman to help others, without a doubt he will be there asking what he can do. Cheers to you Herman! This is so well deserved.

Before joining Ford, Darren was vice president at Rockefeller Foundation, overseeing global and domestic programs. In the 1990s, he was COO of the Abyssinian Development Corporation, Harlem’s largest community development organization.I will be leading the conversation on “Moral Leadership”, a topic Darren wrote about it earlier this month.  A few things we will discuss include his pivot from corporate finance into the nonprofit sector, facing adversity and challenges in tough conversations (including the many he’s had around social inequality and justice), and why surrounding yourself in different, diverse circles is important when taking action and wanting change.

Sanyin Siang,1080735,"“Without trust, we don't truly collaborate; we merely coordinate or, at best, cooperate. It is trust that transforms a group of people into a team.” – Stephen M.R. CoveyLess than half of employees place a great deal of trust in their employer. That leaves a lot of room for improvement.With trust as the foundation for building strong teams, fostering a positive culture, and producing results, how can you build trust as a leader?Sanyin Siang suggests that you can build trust as a team member and leader by sharing your operating principles. When you are explicit about what you care about, you give others a way of interpreting you. You provide them with a guide to how you operate - leaving less room for different interpretations of your actions. ""Do people know what you actually care about?If I asked 3 random members of your team what your top values are, would I get the same answer? Would those answers match your answer?""#leadership #coaching #trust #100leaderslive #wbecs #teamcoaching #psychologicalsafety",4,60,0,0,0,0,1,7,0,1,tendencias,0.59,1018

As we work to recover and address the persistent inequities that have only been exacerbated by COVID, I believe expanding our locally driven network of national service programs can be part of the solution. Today, I am proud to introduce the #CORPSAct with Senator Roger Wicker and a broad bipartisan group of colleagues to double the number of AmeriCorps positions available this year to 150,000, eventually providing 600,000 service opportunities over three years to Americans of every background who want to serve their communities while earning a college tuition scholarship, a decent wage, health care, and valuable skills for the future. These positions could support a variety of response and recovery efforts based on community needs, including expanding food pantry capacity, mentoring and tutoring at-risk students, supporting public health needs, and more. This bill has such strong bipartisan support because we’ve seen the power of national service to strengthen our communities and bring about positive change.

This reality of interrupted attachment between parent and child goes well beyond our family’s saga.

It’s a tough conversation to have, but it’s one that makes us all stronger. Having grown up in an inner-city housing project, I have seen a grace and community that’s possible when we embrace, respect, and value each other.When we reject prejudice, chose to engage with each other, and tap into that rich diversity around us, one that defines us as a nation, we start to see new ways of doing things and free ourselves from the tired, old thinking that led us to this week.There are a lot of questions about where we go now and how we progress that I don’t know the answers to.But we owe it to ourselves to be brave enough to pursue those answers honestly and thoughtfully.

Dan Schulman,189569,"We shouldn't underestimate the pace of changes taking place today. Banking was already being transformed before COVID, but the pandemic has accelerated digital adoption. At Grupo Santander, 44% of our sales is now on digital channels, up from 36% a year ago. Technology is driving down cost of service, big data is enhancing the customer experience, while Big Tech and other players are entering financial services. So the market is changing fast. Last week at our International Banking Conference,  Francisco D'Souza - who I'm delighted has recently joined Santander, Dan Schulman and Nuria Oliver, PhD discussed with James Harding the outlook of financial services with a focus on payments, platforms and their impact on people. The challenge is to build trust and loyalty while offering convenience. Banks have the ability to deliver, particularly in what Frank calls ‘slow money’ (savings, investment, physical assets) thanks to long-term customer relationships built on loyalty. Santander is also competing in the ‘fast money’ landscape (daily expenditures, current checking accounts, etc,) investing in digitalization so we can use our scale to compete.Enjoy the debate here: https://lnkd.in/dJ6S-yD",5,224,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,6,responsabilidad social,0.41,1205

Today, we announced the first steps on our journey to help facilitate the understanding, redemption and interoperability of these new instruments of exchange. We’re starting by introducing the ability to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency directly within the PayPal digital wallet. Early next year, we plan to significantly increase cryptocurrency’s utility by making it available as a funding source for purchases at our 26 million PayPal merchants worldwide.

At the start of my session, we shared a video about Cameron Kirkland, owner of Cam Kirk Studios—a creative studio based in Atlanta.  Cam opened the studio to create a safe haven for artists and to nurture the rising Atlanta creative community. But earlier this year when the pandemic hit, he was forced to temporarily close his studio—which not only affected his bottom line, but also eliminated creative resources that many artists depended on to make a living. To help relieve some of his financial stress, Cam applied for PayPal’s Empowerment Grants for Black Businesses program and was selected as a recipient. He said the grant made him feel recognized: “As an entrepreneur, you can feel like it’s you against the world, but to know that a company like PayPal actually has your back and supports you is an amazing thing.” This challenging year has led all of us to lose our sense of hope at times, but I’m encouraged that these grants are restoring optimism for small businesses.

Dan Schulman,189569,"Protecting the environment is more closely tied to PayPal's mission than many people realize. We know that the increasing frequency and severity of hurricanes, heatwaves, and wildfires, for example, are made worse by climate change. And we also know that these disasters disproportionately impact vulnerable and underserved communities. As a result, estimates show that 100 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty by 2030 due to climate change—a key problem we’re trying to solve for at PayPal. As part of our #ClimateWeek activities at PayPal last week, I hosted a fireside chat for our employees with my personal friend and President of Repairers of the Breach, Reverend Dr. William J. Barber II. Repairers of the Breach is one of PayPal’s partners in advancing racial equity and social justice, and they are a recent recipient of one of PayPal’s grants for nonprofits. During our time together, Reverend Barber spoke to us about three interconnected justices—economic justice, racial justice, and environmental justice—and how they impact people in America. This was an important conversation in so many ways, and one that has reinvigorated our focus on all three areas. I’d like to graciously thank Reverend Barber for joining us, and here is just a small piece of our discussion.",17,214,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,responsabilidad social,0.44,1296

In order to create a diverse and inclusive workforce, it’s critical that organizations take intentional measures to ensure women and people of color have equal opportunity. There are a few actions we can all take to eliminate inequalities within the workplace, particularly within the tech industry:1) By expanding networks when recruiting candidates rather than only looking through an existing rolodex, we can proactively and intentionally diversify candidate pools to find the best talent. 2) Build managers’ skillsets to support women and people of color in their career journeys.3) Create a company culture with inclusion at its core to ensure people throughout the organization have equal opportunities. At PayPal, we’ve required all employees to take conscious inclusion training to bring awareness to our inherent biases, and we’ve focused on achieving pay parity to create a fair workplace for everyone.

MARY SAYS: When I told my father I was going to marry Jake he said, ‘If you marry that man you will never set foot in this house again.’He was horrified that I could contemplate marrying a black man, and I soon learned that most people felt the same way. The first years of our marriage living in Birmingham were hell — I cried every day, and barely ate. No one would speak to us, we couldn’t find anywhere to live because no one would rent to a black man.MARY: Today we have been married for 63 years, and are still very much in love. I do not regret marrying him for an instant, despite all the pain we have suffered.JAKE SAYS: I feel so fortunate to have met & married Mary, but it saddens me that we could not be accepted by society.Nowadays I say to young black people: ‘You have no idea what it used to be like.’When I arrived in the UK I was subjected to abuse every day. Once I was on a bus and a man rubbed his hands on my neck & said: ‘I wanted to see if the dirt would come off.’And back then you couldn’t work in an office — because a black man in an office with all the white girls wasn’t thought to be safe.Full story: https://bit.ly/30PSIGe",115,5156,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,negocios,0.58,1281

Dane E. Holmes,17807,"14 years ago with butterflies in my stomach I joined Goldman Sachs in Salt Lake City. Today I take a break and say goodbye to one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.  Words cannot adequately describe my last 14 years. Full of professional and personal satisfaction. It taught me resilience and humbled me at times. It pushed me in ways I didn’t think possible. And it allowed me to make an impact on people’s lives. My advice as I take this half-time break?  Take care of yourself FIRST so you can in turn care for others. Prioritize people. More important than budgets, presentations, promotions, emails or projects, make people and those relationships a priority. And prepare for the future so you may have the freedom to choose when you walk away and take a break. For my colleagues at Goldman, you are in the right place. No better place with so many bright minds to chart the course forward. For those of you considering GS, I cannot recommend it enough. Whether you are starting a career or making a switch, it will be an experience hard to match anywhere else.  Now I wish I was boarding a plane to see my darling parents at home in Puerto Rico but I’ll be patient and wait for the time to be right.

Jim Citrin,993741,"As I talk to CEOs and leaders of all kinds, two themes are consistently emerging: (1) individuals feeling exhausted as we progress in our year of “virtual reality” and (2) many of these leaders fear losing connectivity to their teams. So this month, I have some reading suggestions!As many head back to school and face new ways of doing things at work and home, my first recommendation is Mindset by Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck. While this wasn't necessarily a page-turner for me, it is a timely and worthy read as we think through how to shift our mindsets to cope with change and growth. My second recommendation is Daring Greatly by Brene Brown. Her combination of personal storytelling and her research around personal connection is inspiring.  My third recommendation is a book that has been on my shelf for many years but I re-read sections from time to time, E.F. Schumacher’s Small is Beautiful: Economics as if People Mattered. Schumacher’s book is not your usual economics text, but one that makes you think about underlying psychology and behavior.

Jim Citrin,993741,"News flash - CEO turnover slows during crises as boards seek stability in volatile times.We at Spencer Stuart and Bain & Company have co-published research related to CEO succession trends during periods of crisis.HIGHLIGHTS:CEO transitions during a recession decline by up to 32%.CEO transitions consistently fall to their lowest level in the year after a recession hits bottom and begin to spike as uncertainty wanes, typically 2 years after the depth of the crisis.We are seeing a similar trend for the Covid crisis thus far. In April and May 2020, CEO successions fell worldwide compared with the same months last year, including by nearly 50% in Europe and Asia.WHY IT MATTERS: The data and insights urge current CEOs to re-imagine their long-term strategies and lean to the expertise on their boards, recognizing that a leadership change may not be the most likely solution.

Jim Citrin,993741,"I’m going to share something I never thought I would on LinkedIn…My profile picture. Why is this such big news for me? Well, I had a previous senior leader say that I was too fat for my job & that I needed to lose weight. Whether true or not, this statement really affected me, so much so that I stopped allowing my photo to be taken, personally & professionally. Removed my picture from LI for fear that people wouldn’t want to work with or employ me because of my weight. I was afraid to share this for fear that everyone else would agree. I wanted my experience, energy, loyalty and passion to do the talking rather than my looks.Someone mentioned how I didn’t have a profile picture on LinkedIn which set off those fears again, but instead of allowing them to spiral, I thought to myself, no, I am confident in my abilities and what I can offer to the world, regardless of how I look, my weight or any other shallow opinion people have about me. I am more than what my appearance is, & so are you.Words hurt, they really do, but I hope that you can take a moment to step away & realise how not fitting into what others tell you is beautiful doesn’t make you ugly, it doesn’t make you a bad worker either.#beautywithin #bodyshaming #badmanagers #confidence #sorrynotsorry #unashamedlyme",3,36,1,0,0,0,1,6,0,0,responsabilidad social,0.74,1289

I don’t have this energy myself in big way and find that if I put on “feminine charm’ I notice its positive effects on men immediately and feel very manipulative. I also feel like its “not me” .

We have natural energy flows and patterns in our body and mind, and in our regular, unregulated states of mind, these patterns can be chaotic of undisciplined. When we do not have discipline, then we suffer. In the practice of yoga we begin to discipline the body, breath, and mind, but we do so gently and steadily. It is not forceful, fast, and impatient. It is steady, consistent, disciplined, and most importantly, joyful.

What I'm most excited about is that these new resources will allow us to further our mission of helping women to realize their life intentions at a moment when we're falling behind socially and economically due to this crisis. The Cru matches circles of women who collaborate to meet their life goals. Then we provide the tools and content to support them.
